[ info ]

This plugin uses TortoiseSVN(http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) and in order to use this plugin this has to be installed.

If you have TortoiseSVN installed and you get an error indicating that the plugin initialization failed to find
the install directy of TortoiseSVN then you manually have to point out where TortoiseSVN is installed.
To do this, open the config file of this plugin (Plugin menu->Tortoise SVN->Open config file) and follow the
instruction in the configuration file.

[ basic instructions ]

All file commands should work 'out-of-the-box' but in order to use the 'project' commands you have to
do a little work.

If you want the project/solution aspect of the Tortoise SVN plugin to work you need to enter the root directory
of you project/solution as a attribute in the SolutionHub. The attributes name is 'svn_root_dir' and should
be the path to the root of you SVN trunk.

NOTE : You ALSO have to setup a connection in the SolutionHub to this plugin(tsvn).
